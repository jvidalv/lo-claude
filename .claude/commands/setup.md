Run the Lo-Claude interactive setup wizard to configure Claude Code settings.

Execute this command:

```bash
cd $ARGUMENTS && npm run setup
```

If no path is provided, use the lo-claude project root. The wizard will guide you through:

1. **Spinner Verbs** — Custom loading messages while Claude thinks
2. **Sound Pack** — Audio feedback for events (OSRS theme available)
3. **Permissions** — Pre-approve common CLI commands

The wizard backs up your current settings before making changes.
